# SentimentAnalysis-from-Twitter
Here I develop a simples ploject in which I do a sentiment analysis of tweets in R.
First I collect tweets in english that mention the term "Pantanal". I intend to evaluate the perception of users in other countries about the situation in the brazilian Biome.
After collect the tweets I did some process until reach the final cleaned text to be analysed.
I thus did a sentiment analysis, in which I join a classification of meaning and thus evaluate whether the most frequent words in tweets are positive or negative.

I also did a example in portuguese, collecting data about the environment minister Ricardo Salles. I did the same process, but it is important to hence that the databases in portuguese are not well developed, and thus the final results has lower quality in comparison to the first results.

Based on the results of both analysis It is possible to evaluate a lot of thins in other analyses, such in regression, classification and association rules, but here i only did this simples exploring steps.

Regards.
